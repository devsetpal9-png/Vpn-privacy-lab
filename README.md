# üîê VPN Privacy Exploration ‚Äî Cybersecurity Internship Task

This project documents my hands-on experience with VPN setup, tunneling protocols, and privacy analysis as part of Task 8 from Elevate Labs' Cybersecurity Internship.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **VPN Client:** ProtonVPN (Free tier)
- **IP Verification:** [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)
- **Traffic Inspection:** Browser Dev Tools (Network tab)

## üì∏ Screenshots

| Screenshot | Caption |
|------------|---------|
| ![VPN Connected](vpn-connected.png) | ProtonVPN connected to Netherlands server |
| ![IP Change](ip-change.png) | IP changed from India to Netherlands ‚Äî verified via whatismyipaddress.com |
| ![Encrypted Traffic](https-traffic.png) | Encrypted traffic confirmed via browser network inspector |

## üìù Summary

I installed ProtonVPN and connected to a nearby server. My IP address changed successfully, and encrypted traffic was confirmed using browser dev tools. I researched OpenVPN and WireGuard protocols, noting their trade-offs in speed and security. This task deepened my understanding of VPNs as privacy tools and their role in secure communication.

## üîç Key Concepts
- VPN tunneling & encryption
- IP masking
- Protocols: OpenVPN vs WireGuard
- VPN limitations: speed, trust, site blocks
