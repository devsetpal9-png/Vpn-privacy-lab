## ðŸŽ¤ VPN Interview Questions & Answers

### 1. What is a VPN?
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet. It masks your IP address and routes traffic through a remote server, enhancing privacy and security.

### 2. How does a VPN protect privacy?
VPNs encrypt your data and hide your real IP address, preventing ISPs, hackers, or surveillance systems from tracking your online activity or location.

### 3. Difference between VPN and proxy?
- **VPN:** Encrypts all traffic and masks IP across the entire device.
- **Proxy:** Routes traffic through a remote server but usually lacks encryption and only works at the application level (e.g., browser).

### 4. What is encryption in VPN?
Encryption in VPNs converts readable data into ciphertext using algorithms like AES-256. This ensures that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be understood without the decryption key.

### 5. Can VPN guarantee complete anonymity?
No. While VPNs improve privacy, they do not guarantee full anonymity. VPN providers may log data, and other factors like browser fingerprinting or DNS leaks can still expose identity.

### 6. What protocols do VPNs use?
Common VPN protocols include:
- **OpenVPN:** Secure and widely supported
- **WireGuard:** Fast and modern with strong encryption
- **IKEv2/IPSec:** Stable and mobile-friendly
- **L2TP/IPSec:** Older, less secure

### 7. What are some VPN limitations?
- Reduced internet speed due to encryption overhead
- Some websites block VPN traffic
- Trust in the VPN provider is essential
- May not prevent all tracking methods (e.g., cookies, fingerprinting)

### 8. How does a VPN affect network speed?
VPNs can introduce latency and reduce bandwidth due to encryption and rerouting through remote servers. Speed depends on server location, protocol used, and provider quality.
