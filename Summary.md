### Task 8: VPN Setup and Privacy Analysis

As part of my cybersecurity internship at Elevate Labs, I explored the role of VPNs in protecting user privacy and securing communication. I chose **ProtonVPN (Free tier)** for its reputation, no-log policy, and ease of use.

#### VPN Setup Steps:
1. Downloaded and installed ProtonVPN on Windows.
2. Created a free account and connected to a nearby server.
3. Verified IP change using [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).
4. Browsed secure websites to confirm encrypted traffic via HTTPS.

#### VPN Protocols:
ProtonVPN supports **OpenVPN** and **WireGuard**:
- **OpenVPN**: Reliable, widely supported, slightly slower.
- **WireGuard**: Lightweight, faster, modern encryption.

#### Benefits of VPNs:
- Encrypts internet traffic, protecting against snooping.
- Masks IP address, enhancing anonymity.
- Helps bypass geo-restrictions and censorship.

#### Limitations:
- Can reduce browsing speed due to encryption overhead.
- Some websites block VPN traffic.
- Trust in VPN provider is essential (especially for free tiers).

#### Observations:
- My IP changed from [original IP] to [VPN IP].
- Browsing speed was slightly reduced, but stable.
- HTTPS traffic confirmed encryption in browser dev tools.

#### Conclusion:
This task gave me hands-on experience with VPN setup, tunneling protocols, and privacy tools. I now understand how VPNs fit into broader network security strategies and their trade-offs in real-world use.
